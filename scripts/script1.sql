Only consider parks where there were at least 10 games played. Report the park name, team name, and average attendance. Repeat for the lowest 5 average attendance.

9. Which managers have won the TSN Manager of the Year award in both the National League (NL) and the American League (AL)? Give their full name and the teams that they were managing when they won the award.

10. Find all players who hit their career highest number of home runs in 2016. Consider only players who have played in the league for at least 10 years, and who hit at least one home run in 2016. Report the players' first and last names and the number of home runs they hit in 2016.*/
